STAY HUMBLE AND\nSTACK SATS.
I THINK I’M GONNA STAY HUMBLE AND STACK SATS ABOUT IT.
WE DIDN’T DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS EASY BUT BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY.
EVERYTHING I BUILT ON NOSTR CAN’T BE STOPPED.
ONWARD.
WE POST IN CAPS. WE LIKE THE COIN. WE ZAP THE SATS.
HASH RATE DOES NOT LEAD PRICE. HASH RATE DOES NOT LAG PRICE. HASH RATE IS THE PRICE. IT IS THE FREEST MARKET IN THE WORLD: ENERGY FOR BITCOIN.
BITCOIN ADOPTION IS EFFECTIVELY A SHORT SQUEEZE ON THE ENTIRE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
THE REPRICING OF THE WORLD IN SATS IS ACCELERATING. 
WE ARE WITNESSING BITCOIN SHORT SQUEEZE THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. BILLIONS ARE SHORT HARD MONEY. FEW REALIZE IT.
WE WILL TEACH THE SUITS A LESSON IN SCARCITY THAT THEY WILL NEVER FORGET.
NO PRIVACY? NO FREEDOM.\nNO FREEDOM? NO WEALTH.
